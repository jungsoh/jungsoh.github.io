# Jung Soh

I have been working in the field of biological data analysis for the last 15 years, mostly dealing with vast amounts of genomic data for humans and other organisms. In my most recent corporate position, I designed and built a medical diagnosis product, where prediction of disease onset by machine learning was the key idea. I am looking to transition to a data science or machine learning role, where I can leverage my data analysis experience and computing skills to tackle AI problems.

I have solid foundation in computing skills required to excel in data science and machine learning. I have experience building target prediction pipelines using open-source tools, including Python, SQL, R, Java and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow. I am eagerly broadening my machine learning and AI skill sets.

My earlier work before biological data analysis was on computer vision, including object detection, video processing and face & gesture recognition, with about 13 years of experience. I am updating these foundational skills in the context of deep learning to be able to solve significant computer vision problems with neural network methods. 

I have managed several multi-disciplinary teams and collaborated with people with diverse background and expertise. In any team, I strive to achieve a shared sense of purpose, resolve conflicts and reach consensus.
