[About me](#about-me)

## About me
    
I have worked in the field of biological data analysis for the last 15 years, dealing mostly with vast amounts of genomic data for humans and other organisms. In my most recent enterprise position, I designed and built a medical diagnosis product, where prediction of disease onset by machine learning was the key idea. I am actively seeking a data science or machine learning role in other industries as well as biotech, where I can leverage my data analysis experience and computing skills to tackle AI problems.

I have solid foundation in computing skills required to excel in data science and machine learning. I have experience building target prediction pipelines using open-source tools, including Python, SQL, R, Java and ML/DL frameworks such as TensorFlow. I am also eagerly expanding my machine learning and AI skill sets.

My earlier work before biological data analysis was on computer vision, including object detection, video processing and face/gesture recognition, with about 13 years of experience. I am updating these foundational skills in the context of deep learning to be able to solve significant computer vision problems with deep neural networks.

I have experience managing several multi-disciplinary teams and collaborated with subject matter experts with diverse expertise, including statisticians, biologists, IT administrators, and project managers.

## Teaching
  
While at [Graz University of Technology](https://tugraz.at/en/home) and earlier at the [University of Calgary](https://ucalgary.ca), I have developed material for and taught courses in Python/R/Bash scripting, bioinformatics labs, and special topics in bioinformatics.

- [Introductory scripting course](https://jungsoh.github.io/intro-scripting-course)
- [Bioinformatics lab course](https://jungsoh.github.io/bioinformatics-lab-course)
- [High-throughput sequence data handling course](https://jungsoh.github.io/high-throughput-sequence-data-handling-course)
- [Transcriptomics course](https://jungsoh.github.io/transcriptomics-course)

## Publications
I have published extensively with my work on biological data analysis and computer vision. Most of my publications can be accessed through my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=52h5BqQAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Patents
I am an inventor on several issued US patents. The fields of invention include molecular diagnosis of disease, biometric identification (signature and face), camera motion detection, and content-based image retrieval.
